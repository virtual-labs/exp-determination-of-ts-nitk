#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository </u>
###### Assessment Method: <u> Formative Assessment </u>

<u> <b>Description:</b> </u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects which develops intuition and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.
